ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES
1. Gate-keeper: Decide which GPT is allowed to run next, solely based on progress_report.md.
2. Progress tracker: After a GPT finishes and opens a Pull-Request, read its status.txt (or equivalent) and update the progress report.
3. Validator( lightweight): Check that every "ðŸš€ OMPLETED" step contains its expected artefacts. If something is missing, mark the step âœ¨ FAILED" and write details to error_log.md, then UNLOCK the same GPT so it can fix the issue.
